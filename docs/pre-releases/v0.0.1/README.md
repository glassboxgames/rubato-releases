___

In this prototype, the player can move left and right with the arrow keys, jump
with the spacebar, and attack with the F key. Touching the moving enemy will
result in death and require the player to reset with the R key. Attacking the
moving enemy will slow it down until it stops completely, at which point the
player can safely touch and jump on it. To enable debug mode (hitbox view),
press "/".
